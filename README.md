# An analysis of kickstarter campaigns

## Overview of Project 
Louise wants to fundraise money for her theatre play "Fever". 
She wants to understand how other plays accomplished the same goal in relation to their launch date and their funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show the relationship between launch dates and funding goals of already submitted plays.

## Analysis and Challenges
Challenges encounter were:
- the dates were displayed in unix format and had to be converted to readable dates
- subcategories had to be created to make the data more granular

The analysis shows that failed campaign goals have about twice the mean than successful campaigns.
The standard deviation of failed campaign goal's is triple the amount of successful campaigns.
The upper quartile of failed campaigns had twice the goal amount of successful campaigns.
The IQR of successful campaign goals is more than half less than that of failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis shows that most successful theatre campain launches are during the month of May.
It also shows that the least amount of successful campaigns were launched in December. 
Even though most campaigns were most successfull during May, it also shows that of all failed campaigns, the most were launched
during the month of May.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis shows that most successful campaigns set a goal of less than $1000 - the success rate was 75.8%. 
It also shows that no campaigns that ended up being successful had a goal between $45k and $49999. All campaigns with this gial
failed.
83.3% of failed campaigns had a goal greater than $50k.

## Results

- Launching a campaign in May will most likey be successful.
- The least amount of campaigns are launched during December.

- Most successful campaigns have a set goal of less than $1000.
- Campaigns that had a goal between $45k and $49999 failed.
